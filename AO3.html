  <h1> Paragraph 1 </h1>
Something I am very interested in would be <b>sketching</b>. Out of all of the art techniques I prefer this one because <u>it allows me to be free with what I am drawing or creating</u>. It also allows me to <u>focus more on what I am drawing</u>  and allows me to not worry about the other aspects like coloring, outlining, or painting.I just prefer it to be shaded with the different graphite pencils I would use. Ever since I started drawing I only liked to sketch things out in sketch books or just grab a pencil and paper and start drawing random things, I also feel that sketching is the most simplest form of art that you don't need a ton of supplies for.

 <h2> Paragraph 2 </h2>
I chose to study biology because I would like to fulfill my dreams of becoming a <b>medical lab tech </b>in a hospital. In biology there is in depth and specific things to learn about which I find very interesting. Aside from all of the interesting topics we have to learn about it also <u>gives me the opportunity to complete research and look into something that could be a problem around the world or just something I find important</u>. Overall studying biology so far has allowed me to learn many new skills in the lab. In conclusion I believe that becoming an MLT will be very rewarding because even though I may not be directly helping others I know I am apart of helping them in some way.
